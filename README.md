My solutions for the assignments.

Count the number of even numbers inputted.

#### Assignment 2 Comments

Remove comments (i.e. comments in code) from input.

#### Assignment 3 Plates
(flex/lex)

#### Assignment 4 Roman Numerals
Flex/Bison (or lex/yacc)
Calculates the inputted roman numerals. First version is lazy work but passed all
tests. Will change hard coded syntax error detection when I have time to something
more elegant.

#### Assignment 5 Roman Numerals
Flex/Bison (or lex/yacc)
Calculates the inputted roman numerals and converts to integers. Looks at the operand,
and performs required calculation. Then a function is called to convert the integers back
to roman numerals.

#### Assignment 6 Calculator with Variables
Flex/Bison (or lex/yacc)
Calculator which can assign variables and does functions such as plus minus divide and multiply.
