# CS3071 - Compiler Design
My solutions for the assignments.

#### Assignment 1 Even Numbers
Count the number of even numbers inputted.

#### Assignment 2 Comments
Remove comments (i.e. comments in code) from input.

#### Assignment 3 Plates
Check the Irish registration plate and determine how old the car is.

#### Assignment 4 Roman Numerals
Flex/Bison (or lex/yacc)
Calculates the inputted roman numerals. First version is lazy work but passed all
tests. Will change hard coded syntax error detection when I have time to something
more elegant.
